# [AOC2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)

For this year, I will be using Rust to solve the puzzles.

## Running the code

Make sure you have [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed.

```bash
cargo run [day 1-25] [part 1-2]
```

Put your input in `input.txt` in the root of the project.

## Pull requests

I will not be accepting pull requests for this repository. This is a challenge for myself to learn Rust and to get better at problem solving and algorithms. I will be happy to discuss the solutions with you, but again, I will not be accepting pull requests.

## License

Please refer to the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file.
